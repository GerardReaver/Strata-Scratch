# Available tables and columns:
# beverages: id, current_year, expiration_year
# Your bar stocks a vast selection of juices, and you need to identify which ones require attention. Identify and sort these juices based on the following clear criteria:

# Old Expired Juices
# Juices where the expiration year is MORE than 6 years before the current year (current_year - expiration_year > 6)
# These need to be recycled immediately
# Almost Expired Juices
# Juices expiring in the current year
# OR juices expiring next year (expiration_year = current_year + 1)
# These need to be sent for renewal
# Follow these steps:

# Extract the IDs of juices that meet either of these criteria
# Rename the ID column to 'to_renew'
# Sort results by processing priority:
# Most urgent first (oldest expired juices)
# Then almost expired juices
# Use (current_year - expiration_year) for sorting

SELECT
    id AS to_renew
FROM
    beverages
WHERE
    current_year - expiration_year > 6
    OR expiration_year = current_year + 1 
    OR expiration_year = current_year
ORDER BY
    current_year - expiration_year DESC
